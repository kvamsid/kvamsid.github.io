* Integrates a Spring-based REST service, containerized using Docker, with an Oracle JET user interface. The primary goal is to facilitate the storage of branch details entered by front-end users. 
* Additionally, the system enables the retrieval of specific branch information, including the visualization of branch locations on a map, leveraging the Google Maps Javascript API. 
* The seamless interaction between the user interface and the backend service enhances the functionality for managing and visualizing branch data efficiently.
